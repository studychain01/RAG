# Graph RAG: Knowledge Graph Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

> **Combines the power of knowledge graphs with vector databases to dramatically improve question-answering performance, especially for multi-hop queries.**

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

This project demonstrates how to overcome the limitations of traditional RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs with vector databases, enabling superior performance on complex, multi-hop queries.

## 🚫 Limitations of Traditional RAG

Traditional RAG systems face several critical challenges when dealing with complex queries:

### 1. **Multi-hop Questions** 🔄

**Problem:** Traditional RAG struggles with questions that require reasoning across multiple facts or steps.

**Example:**
> *"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?"*

**To answer this requires:**
1. **Step 1:** Identify Euler's teacher
2. **Step 2:** Identify that teacher's son  
3. **Step 3:** Determine that son's contribution

**Why it's hard for RAG:**
Traditional RAG retrieves documents based on similarity to the entire query. If no single passage covers all three facts together, the model can't easily stitch the steps across different documents.

### 2. **Complex Entity Relationships** 🔗

**Problem:** It's difficult for RAG to understand nuanced relationships between entities.

**Example:**
> *"Which physicists were influenced by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?"*

**This question assumes:**
- Knowledge of Heisenberg's principle
- Awareness of who was exposed to or referenced it
- A link between those individuals and Heisenberg

**Why it's hard for RAG:**
RAG may retrieve texts about Heisenberg and others separately but not the link showing influence or citation. Entity relationships often span documents or are implicit.

### 3. **Context Fragmentation** 📄

**Problem:** Relevant information is often scattered across different passages that aren't co-located in the corpus.

**Example:**
- One document mentions *"Einstein attended the Solvay Conference."*
- Another says *"Bohr and Einstein debated quantum theory at the conference."*

Neither document alone gives you the complete context of Einstein's debate with Bohr, even though both are relevant.

**Why it's hard for RAG:**
Traditional RAG retrieves and summarizes in isolation. Without stitching or merging related passages, the full picture gets lost.

### 4. **Semantic Gaps** 🕳️

**Problem:** RAG relies on semantic similarity (via embeddings). But sometimes logically important information doesn't "sound" similar.

**Example:**
- **Query:** *"What led to the collapse of the housing market in 2008?"*
- **Relevant fact:** *"Excessive leveraging of subprime mortgages created systemic risk"*

These two pieces may not be semantically close in vector space, so the model may not retrieve the most important evidence.

**Why it's hard for RAG:**
If the wording is different—even if the logic aligns—embedding-based search might miss it.

## 🧠 **Core Implementation Concepts**

### **📊 Understanding the Data Model**

Before diving into the implementation, it's crucial to understand how we structure our data to enable graph-like reasoning with vectors. Our approach transforms traditional text documents into three interconnected components:

| Component | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **🏷️ Entities** | Graph nodes | People, places, concepts, etc. |
| **🔗 Relationships** | Graph edges | Full triplets (subject-predicate-object) |
| **📄 Passages** | Context documents | Original text with detailed information |

### **💡 Why This Structure Works**

By separating entities and relationships into distinct vector collections, we can perform targeted searches for different aspects of a query. When a user asks *"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?"*, we can:

- 🔍 **Find entities** related to "Euler"
- 🔗 **Find relationships** that connect teacher-student and parent-child concepts  
- 🌐 **Expand the graph** to discover indirect connections
- 📚 **Retrieve passages** for final answer generation

---

## 📚 **Data Preparation**

### **🎯 Nano Dataset Example**

We use a nano dataset introducing the relationship between the Bernoulli family and Euler to demonstrate our approach. The dataset contains:

- **4 passages** with detailed context
- **Multiple triplets** representing relationships
- **Subject-Predicate-Object** structure for each relationship

### **🔗 Triplet Structure**

Each relationship is represented as a triplet `[Subject, Predicate, Object]`:

| Triplet | Relationship Type | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| `["Jakob Bernoulli", "was the older brother of", "Johann Bernoulli"]` | Family relationship | Sibling connection |
| `["Johann Bernoulli", "was a student of", "Leonhard Euler"]` | Educational relationship | Teacher-student connection |

### **🛠️ Extraction Methods**

In practice, you can use any approach to extract triplets from your custom corpus:

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **NER + Relation Extraction** | Named Entity Recognition + relationship models | High-precision domains |
| **OpenIE Systems** | Open Information Extraction | General-purpose extraction |
| **LLM Structured Prompting** | Large language models with prompts | Flexible, customizable |
| **Manual Annotation** | Human-curated relationships | Domain-specific precision |

---

## 🏗️ **Building the Knowledge Graph Structure**

### **📋 Entity Extraction Strategy**

We extract unique entities by collecting all subjects and objects from our triplets. This ensures:

- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** of every entity mentioned in any relationship
- ✅ **Complete knowledge domain** representation
- ✅ **No missing connections** between entities

### **🔤 Relationship Representation**

Rather than storing relationships as separate components, we concatenate them into natural language sentences:

**Example Transformation:**
```
Input: ["Jakob Bernoulli", "was the older brother of", "Johann Bernoulli"]
Output: "Jakob Bernoulli was the older brother of Johann Bernoulli"
```

**Advantages:**
- 🧠 **Semantic richness:** Full sentence provides more context for embeddings
- 🤖 **LLM compatibility:** Natural language format for reasoning
- ⚡ **Reduced complexity:** No separate predicate vocabulary management

### **🗺️ Adjacency Mapping Construction**

We build two critical mapping structures for efficient graph traversal:

| Mapping | Purpose | Function |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **`entityid_2_relationids`** | Entity → Relationships | Enables entity-to-relationship expansion |
| **`relationid_2_passageids`** | Relationship → Passages | Enables relationship-to-passage retrieval |

These mappings are essential for the subgraph expansion process, allowing efficient traversal during query time.

---

## 🗄️ **Data Insertion Strategy**

### **📊 Three Milvus Collections**

We create three separate collections, each optimized for different retrieval types:

| Collection | Purpose | Search Pattern | Example Query |
|------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **🏷️ Entity Collection** | Entity-centric queries | Direct semantic similarity | "Find entities similar to 'Euler'" |
| **🔗 Relationship Collection** | Relationship matching | Semantic pattern matching | "Find relationships about teaching" |
| **📄 Passage Collection** | Traditional RAG baseline | Document similarity | "Find relevant passages" |

### **🎯 Why Three Collections?**

This separation enables **multi-modal retrieval**:

- 🔍 **Entity queries:** Retrieve through entity collection
- 🔗 **Relationship queries:** Retrieve through relationship collection  
- 📊 **Combined results:** Merge both paths for comprehensive coverage
- 📈 **Comparison baseline:** Compare against traditional passage retrieval

### **🔗 Embedding Consistency**

All collections use the **same embedding model** to ensure:
- ✅ **Compatibility** during similarity searches
- ✅ **Consistent results** when merging
- ✅ **Reliable performance** across all collections
### **📝 Data Insertion Process**

Insert data with metadata information into Milvus collections, including:
- **Entity collections** with entity embeddings and metadata
- **Relation collections** with relationship embeddings and metadata  
- **Passage collections** with document embeddings and metadata

The metadata includes passage IDs and adjacency entity/relation IDs for efficient graph traversal.

## 🔍 **Online Querying Pipeline**

### **⚡ Understanding the Query Processing Pipeline**

The querying phase implements our core innovation: combining semantic vector search with graph traversal logic. This multi-stage process transforms natural language questions into relevant knowledge:

```
🔍 Query → 🏷️ Entity Identification → 🔍 Dual Retrieval → 🌐 Graph Expansion → 🧠 LLM Reranking → 📝 Answer Generation
```

### **📊 Step-by-Step Process**

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1️⃣ Entity Identification** | Extract entities using NER | Identify key entities in query |
| **2️⃣ Dual Retrieval** | Search entity + relationship collections | Comprehensive coverage |
| **3️⃣ Graph Expansion** | Expand to discover indirect connections | Multi-hop reasoning |
| **4️⃣ LLM Reranking** | Filter and rank relationships | Intelligent selection |
| **5️⃣ Answer Generation** | Retrieve final passages | Generate accurate response |

---

## 🔍 **Similarity Retrieval**

### **🎯 Retrieval Strategy**

We retrieve the top-K similar entities and relations based on the input query from Milvus.

**Entity Retrieval Process:**
- 🔍 **Extract query entities** using NER (Named Entity Recognition)
- 🎯 **Find similar entities** in our knowledge base
- 🔗 **Identify associated relationships** for each entity

**For Custom Queries:** Change the corresponding query NER list to match your specific question.

---

## 🔄 **Dual-Path Retrieval Strategy**

Our approach performs **two parallel similarity searches** for comprehensive coverage:

### **🛤️ Path 1: Entity-Based Retrieval**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Input** | Extracted entities from query (using NER) |
| **Process** | Find entities similar to query entities |
| **Why NER?** | Complex queries reference specific entities ("Euler", "Bernoulli family") |
| **Example** | "What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?" → NER identifies "Euler" |

### **🛤️ Path 2: Relationship-Based Retrieval**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Input** | Complete query text |
| **Process** | Find relationships semantically matching query intent |
| **Purpose** | Captures relational patterns and question structure |
| **Example** | Query pattern "contribution did the son of X's teacher make" matches family connections |

### **✅ Benefits of Dual Retrieval**

- 🔍 **Comprehensive coverage:** Entity path catches direct mentions, relationship path catches semantic patterns
- 🛡️ **Redundancy for robustness:** If one path misses information, the other might capture it
- 🎯 **Different granularities:** Entities provide specific anchors, relationships provide structural patterns

---

## 🌐 **Subgraph Expansion**

### **🔄 Expansion Process**

We use retrieved entities and relations to expand the subgraph and obtain candidate relationships, then merge results from both paths.

**Flow Chart:**
```
🔍 Retrieved Entities/Relations → 🌐 Adjacency Matrix → 🧮 Matrix Multiplication → 📊 Multi-degree Expansion → 🔗 Candidate Relationships
```

### **🧮 The Mathematics of Graph Expansion**

This step is where our approach truly shines! Instead of storing an explicit graph database, we use **adjacency matrices and matrix multiplication** to efficiently compute multi-hop relationships.

#### **📊 Adjacency Matrix Construction**

We create a binary matrix where:
- `entity_relation_adj[i][j] = 1` if entity i participates in relationship j
- `entity_relation_adj[i][j] = 0` otherwise

This sparse representation captures the entire graph structure.

#### **🔢 Multi-Degree Expansion via Matrix Powers**

| Degree | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **1-degree** | `entity_adj_1_degree = entity_relation_adj @ entity_relation_adj.T` | Direct connections |
| **2-degree** | `entity_adj_2_degree = entity_adj_1_degree @ entity_adj_1_degree` | One intermediate step |
| **n-degree** | `entity_adj_n_degree = entity_adj_1_degree^n` | (n-1) intermediate steps |

#### **💡 Why Matrix Multiplication Works**

Matrix multiplication naturally implements graph traversal:

- **1-hop:** Directly connected entities/relationships
- **2-hop:** Entities connected through one intermediate entity  
- **n-hop:** Entities connected through (n-1) intermediate steps

#### **⚡ Computational Efficiency**

Using sparse matrices and vectorized operations, we can expand subgraphs containing **thousands of entities in milliseconds**, making this approach highly scalable.

#### **🔄 Dual Expansion Strategy**

We expand from **both retrieved entities AND retrieved relationships**, then merge the results. This ensures we capture relevant information regardless of which path was more successful initially.

---

## 🧠 **LLM Reranking**

### **🎯 Purpose**

In this stage, we deploy the powerful self-attention mechanism of LLMs to filter and refine candidate relationships. The subgraph expansion provides many potentially relevant relationships, but not all are equally useful for answering specific queries.

### **💡 Why LLM Reranking is Necessary**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🧠 Semantic understanding** | LLMs understand complex query intentions that pure similarity search might miss |
| **🔄 Multi-hop reasoning** | LLMs can trace logical connections across multiple relationships |
| **🎯 Context awareness** | LLMs consider how relationships work together to answer the query |
| **✨ Quality filtering** | LLMs identify and prioritize the most informative relationships |

### **🔧 Chain-of-Thought Prompting Strategy**

We use a structured approach that encourages the LLM to:

1. **🔍 Analyze the query:** Break down what information is needed
2. **🔗 Identify key connections:** Determine which relationship types would be most helpful
3. **🤔 Reason about relevance:** Explain why specific relationships are chosen
4. **📊 Rank by importance:** Order relationships by their utility for the final answer

### **🎓 One-Shot Learning Pattern**

We provide concrete examples of the reasoning process to guide the LLM's behavior, demonstrating how to:
- Identify core entities
- Trace multi-hop connections  
- Prioritize the most direct relationships

### **📋 JSON Output Format**

By requiring structured JSON output, we ensure:
- ✅ **Reliable parsing** of LLM responses
- ✅ **Consistent results** across different queries
- ✅ **Robust production use** with predictable outputs

---

## 📊 **Get Final Results**

### **🔄 Our Method - Graph RAG Process**

1. **Start** with reranked relationships from LLM filtering
2. **Map** relationships back to source passages using `relationid_2_passageids`
3. **Collect** unique passages while preserving relevance order
4. **Return** the top-k most relevant passages for answer generation

### **📈 Baseline - Naive RAG Process**

1. **Directly search** the passage collection using query embeddings
2. **Return** top-k most semantically similar passages
3. **No consideration** of entity relationships or graph structure

### **🔍 Key Differences**

| Aspect | Graph RAG | Naive RAG |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Reasoning approach** | Reasons through entity relationships | Relies on surface-level semantic similarity |
| **Multi-hop capability** | ✅ Traces logical chains | ❌ Misses indirect connections |
| **Context understanding** | ✅ Coherent relationship-based context | ❌ Fragmented document context |

### **🎯 Expected Outcome**

For multi-hop questions like *"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?"*, our Graph RAG approach should:

1. **🔍 Identify the reasoning chain:** Euler → Johann Bernoulli (teacher) → Daniel Bernoulli (son) → contributions
2. **📚 Retrieve relevant passages:** Find passages about Daniel Bernoulli's contributions to fluid dynamics
3. **💡 Provide accurate answers:** Generate responses based on correct contextual information

**In contrast,** naive RAG might retrieve passages about Euler directly or miss the multi-hop connection entirely, leading to incomplete or incorrect answers.

---

## 🏆 **Key Insights and Learning Outcomes**

### **📊 Performance Analysis**

#### **❌ Naive RAG Limitation**
Traditional similarity search fails because the query *"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?"* doesn't have high semantic similarity to passages about Daniel Bernoulli's fluid dynamics contributions. The surface-level keywords don't match well.

#### **✅ Graph RAG Success**
Our method successfully traces the logical chain:
- Query mentions "Euler" 
- → Entity retrieval finds "Leonhard Euler"
- → Graph expansion discovers "Johann Bernoulli was Euler's teacher"
- → Further expansion finds "Daniel Bernoulli was Johann's son"
- → Relationship filtering identifies Daniel's contributions
- → Correct passages retrieved
